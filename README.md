# Azure Function App with Service Bus Trigger

This repository contains a C# .NET Azure Function App that utilizes Azure Service Bus triggers to process messages and store data into Azure Data Lake Storage. It also includes support for handling messages that encounter processing issues through a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).

## Overview

This Azure Function App is designed to:

- **Listen to Azure Service Bus**: The app is triggered whenever a message is published to an Azure Service Bus queue or topic.

- **Process and Store Data**: Upon receiving a message, the app processes the data and securely stores it in Azure Data Lake Storage.

- **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) Support**: In case a message encounters issues during processing, it's sent to a Dead Letter Queue. This app includes DLQ triggers to handle and process messages from the DLQ and store them in Azure Data Lake Storage as well.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Azure Function App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/PtPrashantTripathi/AzureFunctionApp_ServiceBus.git
    ```

2. **Configure Azure Service Bus**: Set up your Azure Service Bus with the necessary queues or topics to send messages to.

3. **Configure Azure Data Lake Storage**: Configure your Azure Data Lake Storage where you want to store the processed data.

4. **Azure Function Configuration**: Update the Azure Function App's configuration to include connection strings and other required settings. You can use the `local.settings.json` file for local development and Azure Function Application Settings for production.

5. **Deploy to Azure**: Deploy your Azure Function App to your Azure subscription. You can use Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or other deployment methods of your choice.

6. **Testing**: Send messages to your Azure Service Bus queue or topic, and the Azure Function App will automatically process them and store the data in Azure Data Lake Storage. You can also test the DLQ functionality to ensure that problematic messages are appropriately handled.
